For this assignment we explored how to use shaping functions to change color and generate shapes. I started with some of the simpler ideas from the Book of Shading, and worked my way up to using the time uniform to include moving shapes. My process was to workshop scenes seperately until I had something I liked that could be layered or transitioned to. When I was happy with the progression of the scenes, I looked for a song that would go nicely and regorded the progression.
